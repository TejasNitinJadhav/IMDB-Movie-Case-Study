We have our IMDB Movie Rating dataset to extract insights from, while the goal of this project is to study the evolution of cinema over decades. Some insights about how the preferable movie genres have changed over time, some graphs of profits that movies make VS their investments, the number of people voting for a particular actor, and the top 250 directors of all time have been studied. \n","\n","### Approach :\n","\n","Starting with data inspection, the entire project is divided into 3 main tasks: inspection, data cleaning and exploratory data analysis. Further, these tasks are divided into more subtasks. Inspection involves getting to know the dataframe, the shape of data and it's data types. Data cleaning involves finding the number of missinf values, their percentages in each column, dropping them if necessary, and building a cleaned new dataframe to finally extract insights from. \n","\n","### Tech Stack used :\n","\n","A Jupyter Notebook was used for the entire analysis purpose, the version being 6.4.0. Besides a notebook , python libraries of pyplot from matplotlib, numpy, and pandas were been used.\n","\n","### Insights : \n","\n","The purpose of analysis this data set was to study the top genres, people's interests over time, and the best actors and directors of all time, and all of these goals have been achieved. For eg: Sci-Fi and Family is the most sought after genre, while Charles Chaplin tops the best directors' list, and Leonardo Caprio has aced all the lists for fan following, with Meryl Streep and Brad Pitt among others.\n","\n","### Result :\n","\n","The IMDB Movie Rating Dataset was successfully analysed and informative insights regarding the top movies and their evolution since the past few years has been studied. \n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"mvlLrv0rIYeP"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Supress Warnings\n","\n","import warnings\n","warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"4jB4s-qyIYeQ"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Import the numpy and pandas packages\n","\n","import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"qx6ycF5lIYeQ"},"source":["## Task 1: Reading and Inspection\n","\n","-  ### Subtask 1.1: Import and read\n","\n","Import and read the movie database.
